# Prompt
You are an expert in AI evaluation and product design.
Task: Create a concise but structured document for evaluating an AI system for the following use-case: [insert use-case description here].
The document should follow this flow:
Frameworks: Identify the key evaluation frameworks (engines) applicable in this domain.


Metrics: Define gauge/metric parameters for each dimension of evaluation (technical performance and responsible AI/governance).


Structure: Lay out a deep evaluation structure covering lifecycle stages (Context → Data/Model → Deployment → Monitoring → Reporting).


Features: Translate the evaluation structure into product/features (e.g., dashboard/tooling) that make the evaluation actionable and embedded.


Start with a short summary of the thought process: why we evaluate across multiple dimensions (accuracy, safety, fairness, transparency, robustness, sustainability), and how the flow above ensures a logical progression.
Constraints:
Keep each section clear and to the point.


Use bullet or numbered lists for readability.


Avoid long paragraphs; aim for clarity and structure.


Do not use “—” for bullet points (use regular bullets or numbers).


Use-case details:
 [Insert brief description of the system: domain, stakeholders, key risks, what the AI is doing]
