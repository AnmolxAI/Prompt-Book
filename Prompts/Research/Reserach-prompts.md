# Effective LLM Research Prompts

This document contains structured prompts designed to extract high-quality, nuanced research from Large Language Models (LLMs) that i use on a daily basis.

## 1. The "Landscape & Taxonomy" Prompt
**Goal:** To obtain a structured overview, terminology, and hierarchy of a new topic.

> **Prompt:**
> "Act as a PhD-level research assistant in **[Field/Topic]**. Provide a comprehensive structural breakdown of **[Specific Subject]**.
> 1. Define the core concepts and standard terminology used in the field.
> 2. Outline the major branches or sub-disciplines related to this topic.
> 3. Identify the mental models or frameworks experts use to analyze this subject.
> 4. Present this information in a hierarchical format or table for easy scanning."

## 2. The "Schools of Thought" Prompt
**Goal:** To understand debates and opposing viewpoints to avoid bias.

> **Prompt:**
> "I am researching **[Topic/Debate]**. Please survey the current academic or professional landscape and summarize the major 'schools of thought.'
> * **Consensus:** What do most experts agree on?
> * **Contention:** What are the primary areas of active debate or disagreement?
> * **Key Figures:** Who are the leading voices or authors associated with each perspective?
> Please represent the opposing viewpoints neutrally."

## 3. The "Literature Gap" Prompt
**Goal:** To find limitations in current research and brainstorm angles for new projects.

> **Prompt:**
> "Analyze the current discourse regarding **[Topic]**. Based on general knowledge up to your cutoff date, identify:
> 1. **Limitations:** What are the common criticisms of current methodologies or theories in this space?
> 2. **Underexplored Areas:** What specific questions or sub-topics appear to be neglected or require further investigation?
> 3. **Future Trends:** Where is the research likely heading in the next 5 years?"

## 4. The "Socratic Stress-Test" Prompt
**Goal:** To critique a hypothesis or draft and identify logical fallacies.

> **Prompt:**
> "I am going to present a hypothesis/argument regarding **[Topic]**. I want you to act as a critical peer reviewer or a Devil's Advocate.
>
> **My Argument:** [Insert your summary or thesis here].
>
> Please critique this strictly. Identify logical fallacies, potential biases, counter-examples, or alternative explanations that I have failed to consider. Do not be polite; focus on rigorous intellectual scrutiny."

## 5. The "Synthesis & Analogies" Prompt
**Goal:** To connect two distinct ideas or explain complex concepts to laypeople.

> **Prompt:**
> "I am trying to understand the relationship between **[Concept A]** and **[Concept B]**.
> 1. Synthesize these two concepts: Where do they intersect, and where do they contradict each other?
> 2. Provide 3 distinct analogies to explain this relationship to a layperson.
> 3. Provide one real-world case study or historical example where these two concepts interacted."
